It is seated in a 2.7 hectare lot at the corner of East Avenue and Matalino Street, Diliman, Quezon City, proximate to other Specialty hospitals. PHC was established through Presidential Decree No. 673 (Annex B-PD 673 Creation of PHC) as the Philippine Heart Center for Asia and inaugurated on February 14, 1975.</p>

            <p class="leading-5"> Driven by its core values, our mission is attained in four tracks: (1) Excellence in Cardiovascular care in tune with current trends of diagnosis and management; (2) Advocacy on prevention and wellness to decrease the risk of dying from heart diseases; (3) Treat more and reach out to underprivileged through satellite regional heart centers; and (4) Excellence in research and cardiovascular training accessible to all. It is on this mandate that the PHC remains. By the words of the First lady Imelda Marcos since PHC conception in 1975, “Be there one Filipino sick and uncared for, our mission is not done.”</p>
